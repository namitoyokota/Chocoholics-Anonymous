# Chocoholics-Anonymous
For CS 200 (Software Design and Engineering) Course at UA, in a team of five including myself, we developed a software for Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn), an organization dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate in all its glorious forms.

## Basic Concept
Members pay a monthly fee to ChocAn entitled to unlimited consultations and treatments with health professionals. Each health care professional, provider, provides service to ChocAn members. ChocAn user, operators, can manage accounts for those members and providers. Managers are also another ChocAn member that can request reports for further research. More information can be found in 'manual/ChocAn.pdf'.

## Steps
To run this software, a runnable jar is already outputted under 'release/ChocAn.jar'. By double clicking the file, the software will start running.

## Tools Used
 - Eclipse
 - BitBucket
 - Java
 - Swing (Java GUI)

## What I learned
Through working on this project, I learned
 - the importance of communication with a team
  + while this may be abvious, we struggled to spend time together through busy schedule
 - the importance of comments
  + because each member worked on their individual classes, we struggled to understand each other's code and use it to implement other classes
 - Version Control
 - Software Development process

#### Disclaimer
This project is done with a team of four and myself.
